# Eigenbroetler.jl

Eigenbroetler.jl is software for the manipulation of complex valued data. Its intended use is in the domains of image processing and Fourier optics, but it may have application in other domains as well.

Eigenbroetler.jl is a Julia rewrite of the original C++ library. The same algorithms ~~are~~ will eventually be provided, but there is no GUI component.

The  software was designed and written by Michael Oldfield and Kieran Larkin. It is published under the [MIT LICENCE](LICENSE.md). We would like to encourage its use, and welcome any feedback (particularly constructive feedback).
